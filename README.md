## 3. Project Title / Description

This project aims to develop a database-driven **Transaction Confirmation System** using SQL. The system records and manages payment information when a customer purchases a product through a Point of Sale (POS).

It stores key details such as:

* Customer identity
* Purchased products and quantity
* Total amount
* Payment method
* POS location
* Transaction date and time

Each transaction is first recorded with a **Pending** status and later updated to **Confirmed** or **Failed** based on the payment result.

The database uses multiple related tables:

* Customers
* Products
* POS Terminals
* Transactions
* Transaction Items

This system demonstrates how businesses track sales, confirm payments, and maintain reliable transaction records for reporting and analysis.

## 4. Problem Statement

Businesses need a reliable way to record and verify customer payments made through POS systems. Without a structured system, transaction data may be lost, inconsistent, or difficult to track, causing errors in payment confirmation and financial reporting.

This project solves the problem by creating a structured SQL database that:

* Securely stores transaction details
* Tracks payment status (Pending, Confirmed, Failed)
* Maintains accurate records of who purchased what, when, and where

---

## 5. Project Objectives

* Design a structured SQL database for transaction management
* Record customer, product, POS, and time information
* Implement payment status tracking
* Ensure data integrity using relationships and constraints
* Enable easy retrieval of transaction data for monitoring and reporting

---

## 6. Scope of the System

The system manages transaction data generated from a POS. It includes:

* Customer information
* Product details
* POS terminal data
* Transaction records with items, amount, payment method, status, and timestamp

**Limitations:**

* No user interface
* No real payment gateway integration
* No inventory management or authentication
* Designed for educational purposes only

---

## 7. Expected Users

* Store Cashiers – record sales transactions
* Store Managers – review sales and transaction history
* Business Owners – analyze revenue and performance
* System Administrators – maintain the database
